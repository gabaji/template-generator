# We can have some defined format which can be exported 
# snippets of different IDEs. I am thinking of best approach for that

# 1. We can have a JSON which will contain the code snippet and arguments
# 2. Just keep filename as key and file contents as snippet.
#  Option 1 will introduce some additional complexity but have more scope 
#  of customizations
